### Opium City: The Making of Early Victorian Bombay

Amar Farooqui was on my book list because he is cited multiple times in Smoke and Ashes. It was a map on the back jacket of this book, titled "Bombay, C. 1670, Showing the Seven Original Islands" that made me pick up this particular book. The map itself is fascinating because Mahim, Worli, and Malabar Hill were all islands in the 17th century. Much of 'urban' central and south Bombay of today was swamp land then. Mentally superimposing a map of today's Mumbai onto this is a mind-expanding excercise, especially when considering the many reclamations (culminating in the Coastal Road), and the fact that today the city is one land-mass.

The book is a slim volume containing three essays. The first essay talks about the beginnings of Bombay and factors that aided its rise. It came as a surprise to me that the city was obscure until the end of the 18th century despite having a good harbor. It was export of cotton and opium that completely altered this. A fun fact I learnt was that all of Suburban Mumbai today was the Salsette Island then. 

The second essay talks about how trade in Malwa opium made Bombay a key financial center in western India. Compared to the top-down opium trade in the Gangetic belt, Malwa opium trade was bottom-up. Farooqui highlights how this was important in creating a prosperous capitalist class and resilient trading networks in western India and in Bombay. The third essay titled "Urban Development in Early Victorian Bombay" is my favourite. It makes the city from another era come alive by detailing land use patterns in the city, important people of the day, buildings, food, and public health, among others.
