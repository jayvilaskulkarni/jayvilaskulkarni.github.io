## Non-Fiction

### Gods, Guns and Missionaries

### Smoke and Ashes

Two commodities have had an outsized impact on India's economy in the 19th century- cotton and opium. While the importance of raw cotton and the textile trade are alive in popular imagination, the thriving opium trade is scant known. You might find the quote below surprising:

> *So improbable do the words ‘opium factory’ sound today that it came as a surprise to me to learn that the Ghazipur factory is still up and running (the Patna factory was shuttered a long time ago). Nor is it a ghostly relic of the past—it is to this day one of the world’s largest producers of legal opium, manufactured for medicinal use.* (Pg 63)

### Opium City: The Making of Early Victorian Bombay

Amar Farooqui was on my book list because he is cited multiple times in Smoke and Ashes. It was a map on the back jacket of this book, titled "Bombay, C. 1670, Showing the Seven Original Islands" that made me pick up this particular book. The map itself is fascinating because Mahim, Worli, and Malabar Hill were all islands in the 17th century. Much of 'urban' central and south Bombay of today was swamp land then. Mentally superimposing a map of today's Mumbai onto this is a mind-expanding exercise, especially when considering the many reclamations (culminating in the Coastal Road), and the fact that today the city is one land-mass.

The book is a slim volume containing three essays. The first essay talks about the beginnings of Bombay and factors that aided its rise. It came as a surprise to me that the city was obscure until the end of the 18th century despite having a good harbor. It was export of cotton and opium that completely altered this. A fun fact I learnt was that all of Suburban Mumbai today was the Salsette Island then.

The second essay talks about how trade in Malwa opium made Bombay a key financial center in western India. Compared to the top-down opium trade in the Gangetic belt, Malwa opium trade was bottom-up. Farooqui highlights how this was important in creating a prosperous capitalist class and resilient trading networks in western India and in Bombay. The third essay titled "Urban Development in Early Victorian Bombay" is my favourite. It makes the city from another era come alive by detailing land use patterns in the city, important people of the day, buildings, food, and public health, among others.

## Good Fiction

### My Brilliant Friend (the Neapolitan Quartet)

### The Many Lives of Syeda X

Neha Dixit's book paints the life trajectory of 'Syeda X' and her daughter through the 1980s till 2000s, while giving the readers a flavour of important political events and social currents of the time. Syeda cycles through hundreds of jobs and migrates multiple times -- all due to external events. It highlights how religious riots and labour laws can uproot lives of people in the informal economy.

## Light Fiction

### The Bangalore Detectives Club

### Days at the Morisaki Bookshop

On rare occasions, I buy a book simply because of the way its cover looks. 'Days at the Morisaki Bookshop' was one of those books.

## Mumbai

### Maximum City

### Muses over Mumbai
