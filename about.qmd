## Education:

### Bocconi University

### Azim Premji University

I completed my B.A. (Honours) in Economics from [Azim Premji University](https://azimpremjiuniversity.edu.in/programmes/ba-in-economics) (Bengaluru). I took courses in **economic theory** (such as Intermediate Microeconomics and Macroeconomics, Econometrics and Political Economy), **quantitative tools** (Linear Algebra, Statistics, and Computational Economics), and on **research methods** (Communicating Economics, and Academic Writing). I completed my Honours thesis under Professor [Amit Basole](https://azimpremjiuniversity.edu.in/people/amit-basole). The thesis was an empirical project that analyzed the effect of COVID-19 on India's consumption expenditure. I used a regression framework to tease-out peculiar trends in consumption-inequality. Working on the thesis, various data assignments, and term papers during this program motivated me to deepen my understanding of theory, economic tools and skills. I became passionate about data visualization in R and typesetting in LaTeX. I took electives like 'Climate Change Economics', and 'Structural Change, Growth and Development' which introduced me to new perspectives. (work in progress section).

### Rishi Valley School

I am a proud alum of [Rishi Valley School, KFI](https://www.rishivalley.org/) (Madnapalle). The six years I spent at this residential school have greatly shaped me and my outlook towards life. Our days had a balanced structure. We would wake up early for physical training (running/strength/sports), go for classes, play sports in the evening, reflect for some time on the *asthachal* hill and then go for the study hour (*prep*). Like all RV alumni who have 'lived in the outside world', I confess that the dining hall food was amazing. But this place was so much more. I got introduced to bird-watching by the renowned ornithologist Dr. V Shantaram. The current affairs club, carefully curated by then-director [Radhika Herzberger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radhika_Herzberger) encouraged us to dive deeper and seek explanations for major events of the time. Our teachers encouraged us to read widely- from fiction, to technical and philosophical texts. I learnt to express myself in new ways- through [Gieve Patel's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gieve_Patel) poetry workshops, Sonali *akka's* theater classes and by doing pottery, needlecraft and batik. I grew as a person through my journey in sports. I entered RV with little interest in sports, discovered and played basketball consistently over the years and I graduated from school as the basketball captain. The school was also frequently visited by alumni and great minds from diverse walks of life- their talks during assemblies inspired me and exposed me to new ideas.

## Work Experience:

### LEAP, Bocconi University

I worked as a research assistant to [Professor Andrea Guariso](https://www.andreaguariso.net/home) at the Laboratory for Effective Anti-Poverty Policies (LEAP) over the summer of 2023. I was selected in the [LEAP Internship Program](https://leap.unibocconi.eu/vacancies/internship-program). A new skill I learnt was to do 'fuzzy matching' of data in Stata. I further used the ['LEDA' package](https://github.com/carl-mc/LEDA) in R, which was specifically designed to match ethnic data-sets in Africa (relevant for the project). Using the LEDA package made me understand the basics of Object Oriented Programming. I also learnt QGIS to handle spatial data and attended workshops on research methods for development economics.

### XKDR Forum

I am presently collaborating with [XKDR Forum](https://xkdr.org/) (Mumbai) as a quantitative researcher. I have been involved in a project on measuring the effect of finance on household consumption management. We are using longitudinal micro-data from India for the project. I regularly visualize data and run regressions using R for the project. At XKDR, I have learnt to document my work systematically and to create functions from scratch in R. Working here has motivated me to learn more about open-source systems and to master the command line (great for productivity!), which is used de-facto at the organization.

### Centre for Sustaiable Employment

I worked as a research assistant to Professors Amit Basole and Anand Shrivastava at CSE (Bengaluru). Ô∏è
