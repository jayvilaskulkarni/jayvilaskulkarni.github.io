## Education:

### Bocconi University

### Rishi Valley School

## Work Experience:

### LEAP, Bocconi University

I worked as a research assistant to [Professor Andrea Guariso](https://www.andreaguariso.net/home) at the Laboratory for Effective Anti-Poverty Policies (LEAP) over the summer of 2023. I was selected in the [LEAP Internship Program](https://leap.unibocconi.eu/vacancies/internship-program). A new skill I learnt was to do 'fuzzy matching' of data in Stata. I further used the ['LEDA' package](https://github.com/carl-mc/LEDA) in R, which was specifically designed to match ethnic data-sets in Africa (relevant for the project). Using the LEDA package made me understand the basics of Object Oriented Programming. I also learnt QGIS to handle spatial data and attended workshops on research methods for development economics.

### XKDR Forum

I am presently collaborating with [XKDR Forum](https://xkdr.org/) (Mumbai) as a quantitative researcher. I have been involved in a project on measuring the effect of finance on household consumption management. We are using longitudinal micro-data from India for the project. I regularly visualize data and run regressions using R for the project. At XKDR, I have learnt to document my work systematically and to create functions from scratch in R. Working here has motivated me to learn more about open-source systems and to master the command line (great for productivity!), which is used de-facto at the organization.

### Centre for Sustaiable Employment

I worked as a research assistant to Professors Amit Basole and Anand Shrivastava at CSE (Bengaluru). Ô∏è
