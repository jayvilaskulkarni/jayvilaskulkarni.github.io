## Brief

I am an economics graduate from Bocconi University, Milan (MSc in Economic and Social Sciences), where I currently work as a researcher.

I cherish data-driven insights, and take interest in empirical economic research. Applied econometrics and Macroeconomic development are my areas of interest. I am also passionate about data visualization.
